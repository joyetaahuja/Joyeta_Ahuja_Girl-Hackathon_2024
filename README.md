StarSift:Celestial Solutions For Disaster Damage Assessment
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Disaster Relief: Improve disaster response using satellite imagery, geospatial data, and environmental information for areas affected by floods, wildfires and similar disasters.

The Solution

According to the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), there were 399 natural disaster-related calamities in 2023. These incidents had an impact on 93.1 million people and resulted in 86,473 fatalities.
Every year, countless lives are claimed by natural disasters, but can AI aid lessen damage? With StarSift, it can.
Presenting to you StarSift which captures the essence of utilizing satellite imagery (represented by "Star") to sift through data and provide innovative solutions for assessing damage ("Sift").

The approach is to identify buildings and rate the amount of damage they suffered after a natural disaster using satellite images that were taken before and after the disaster.


StarSift takes two images, one pre-disaster and one post-disaster. The images capture 19 natural disasters of 5 different types from all over the world.In the post-disaster images, each building is assigned a class label based on how terribly it was damaged which range from 0(No damage) to 3(Completely destroyed).The idea is to accurately detect locations of damaged buildings, scoring them as undamaged, having minor or major damage, or destroyed.People would then be aware of which buildings are safe to use as shelter and which should be avoided.The ML model also color codes the images for detection. In all images where red shows destroyed structures, yellow shows major damage, blue is minor damage and green is undamaged.


StarSift predicts post-disaster conditions to aid rescue operations, guiding teams to prioritize areas for immediate rescue and identify safe zones. Hence, easing out the relief and rescue process and saving more lives.

IDEATION STRATEGY
Disaster Level    Structure Description
0 (No Damage)     Undisturbed. No sign of water, structural or shingle damage, or burn marks.
1 (Minor Damage)  Building partially damaged, roof elements missing , or visible cracks.
2 (Major Damage)  Major destruction, partial wall or roof collapse.
3 (Destroyed)     Completely collapsed, no longer present.

Impact
The impact of the project extends to multiple levels. Firstly,it helps rescue teams figure out where to go first by quickly and accurately checking how many buildings are damaged. This can save more lives. Secondly, it helps communities affected by disasters by showing safe places to go for shelter and evacuation.

Feasibility
The feasibility of the project appears promising. I have access to the necessary resources, including a meaningful dataset of pre- and post-disaster satellite images, as well as technical expertise in AI and machine learning. Additionally, in future identified partnerships with domain experts in disaster relief and satellite imaging will  enhance the project's implementation and feasibility.
